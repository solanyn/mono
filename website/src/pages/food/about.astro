					<p>I'm a food hobbyist who chases flavour. Most of what I cook starts from someone else's recipe — I adapt it, take notes on what worked, and try to make it better next time.</p>
					<p>At some point I realized I was consistently making food I preferred over eating out. Not because I'm a great cook, but because I can tune things exactly to my taste and I'm not afraid to spend time on it.</p>
					<p>This site is my cooking journal. Recipes here are adaptations with inline notes on what I changed and why. Ratings are subjective and based on <a href="/food/scoring/">my scoring criteria</a>. Gear recommendations are things I actually own and use.</p>
					<p>This site contains no affiliate links. If that changes, I'll disclose it here.</p>
