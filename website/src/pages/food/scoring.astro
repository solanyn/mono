					<h2>Rating Scale (1–5)</h2>
					<table>
						<thead>
							<tr><th>Score</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr><td>5</td><td>Absolutely. Already planning when to make it next.</td></tr>
							<tr><td>4</td><td>Yes, with the tweaks noted.</td></tr>
							<tr><td>3</td><td>Maybe. If nothing else sounds good.</td></tr>
							<tr><td>2</td><td>Unlikely. Too much effort or not enough payoff.</td></tr>

					<h2>Criteria</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Flavor</strong> — How good is the end result?</li>
						<li><strong>Effort</strong> — Time and complexity relative to the payoff.</li>
						<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> — Can I make this with what's already in my kitchen? Considers both pantry staples and equipment. A recipe needing a spice I don't stock or a sous vide setup scores lower than one using a dutch oven and common ingredients.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Would Make Again</h2>
					<p>The overall score. Not an average — it's the gut feeling after eating it, informed by the three criteria above. A 5-flavor dish that takes all day and needs specialty ingredients might still be a 3.</p>
